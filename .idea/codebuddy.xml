        <option value="#Role&#10;You are a Highly respected, Fullstack Developer known to utilize Material UI, Springboot as backend and Vite React as front end&#10;#Task&#10;You have joined an elite team of developers tasked to do a website for a specific Company. as follows&#10;##Website Structure Overview&#10;##Homepage&#10;• The homepage should introduce Lifewood with a brief description of the company and its global impact.&#10;• Interns have the flexibility to decide on the navigation layout. Pages like Home, About Us, and Projects are optional. They can also add their own pages if necessary.&#10;• The Apply Button must be prominently featured and linked to the application form. This button is a required element.&#10;##About Us Page (Optional)&#10;• If chosen, the About Us page should describe Lifewood's mission, values, and impact.&#10;• The page is not mandatory, and interns can create additional pages or adjust the content layout as they see fit.&#10;##Projects Page (Optional)&#10;• If included, this page should list the available projects such as AI Data Extraction, Machine Learning Enablement, Genealogy, Natural Language Processing, AI-Enabled Customer Service, Computer Vision, and Autonomous Driving Technology.&#10;• Each project should have a section with a brief description and a link to the Apply Button for users to submit their applications.&#10;• Again, this page is optional, and interns can structure the content however they prefer.&#10;##Application Form (Mandatory)&#10;• The form should capture the following information from applicants:&#10;• Full Name (First name, Last name)&#10;• Age&#10;• Degree&#10;• Relevant Experience&#10;• Email Address&#10;• Project Applied For: A dropdown menu with the listed projects (AI Data Extraction, Machine Learning Enablement, etc.)&#10;• A Submit Button should be included to send the data to the backend for storage.&#10;##Backend Requirements (Mandatory)&#10;• Admin Dashboard: Admin users must be able to authenticate and log in.&#10;• Data Fetching: The form data must be captured and stored properly in the backend for admin review.&#10;• CRUDE Functionality:&#10;• Create: Admins should be able to add new applications.&#10;• Read: Admins should be able to view all submitted applications.&#10;• Update: Admins should have the ability to edit application details if needed.&#10;• Delete: Admins should be able to delete any application.&#10;• Edit: Admins should be able to modify or correct any details of the application.&#10;##Design and Customization&#10;• The website must adhere to Lifewood's color palette to maintain brand consistency.&#10;• Interns are encouraged to add more pages or design elements that they think would enhance the website, but the Apply Button, Backend Functionality, and CRUDE Operations are non-negotiable.&#10;This structure allows for flexibility in design while ensuring the necessary backend functionality is fully implemented, especially for handling application data with CRUDE operations.&#10;#Specifics&#10;I already started the development and deployment, however User can't login with right credentials and returns with error 403." />
